                            <p>Attorney General William Barr released his redacted version of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report (https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf) on Russian election interference and obstruction of justice by President Trump. Following a press conference, the report is expected to be heavily scrutinized and come under significant controversy for Barr’s extensive redactions. The report can be found here: https://www.justice.gov/storage/report.pdf Mirrors: Washington Post (https://games-cdn. Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III did not find that Donald Trump’s campaign or any of his associates conspired with Russia in its efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, according to a summary of Mueller’s findings sent to lawmakers Sunday. “The Special Counsel’s investigation did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election,” says the four-page summary. So I originally posted this to r/confession a couple nights ago, and thought here might also appreciate the story. Obligatory: this fuck up did not happen today, but nearer to two years ago. As a disclaimer: this is my first Reddit post and on mobile so apologise for formatting yada-yada-yada. So this happened about 18 months ago, or somewhere in the vicinity of 18-20 months. I still get flak from this from both family and friends. So, the setting: my uncle’s wedding. It’s around Autumn.

Friendly reminder that speculation on an individual's mental health. Seems like there are multiple weekly posts here by young adults saying that they're just turning 18 and their parents are tossing them out of the house. But reasons are rarely given. For those of you that have been in that situation (either parent or child), and it's now a few years in the past so no longer "heat of the moment" thinking, what were the reasons that caused the sudden get-the-heck-out problem? Just surprised at the sheer number of these posts, and can't believe that it's mostl. 
I'm so sick and tired, I want to cry. I hate that they claim that a potential human being should be reason enough for me them to control my uterus, my life, and for me to suddenly stop the rest of my life and become completely dedicated to a baby that doesn't even exist yet. I just want them to realize abortions aren't this fun thing that women do just for the lolz. We actually have the responsibility of our fertility pretty much from birth, and yet all of our efforts our undermine # Praise thy! TL;DR of the TL;DR: To enter, comment only once to this post.

Not good enough, I was not able to get online before that. I posted part of this in r/amitheasshole as a recent conflict I will bring up later left me doubting myself but due to so many peoples interest I've decided to elaborate my family’s boundless entitlement here. I am currently in custody of my two little sisters (Amy who is 17 and Liza who is 8 - not their real names for obvious reasons - I am a 29 male and we live in Australia – I am Potato as that’s what Liza calls me) and this is basically the story of how my family felt they were entitled. Background The story I want to tell you is full of sadness and heartache. I started out life in poverty living with my parents in a house that had some wooden floors and mostly dirt floors. My mother has a long list of mental issues and my father was an alcoholic and thankfully not the abusive type. Me and my sister were taken from our home when I was 7 and she was 4. We got placed into the foster care system in Kentucky. I'm not going to use real names, but I will use the initials. My younger brother, let's call him John \ 18\ , was subjected to random drug testing at his high school last week. (He knew he was eligible for it, students must sign a consent form at the start of the school year). He is a frequent smoker, and tested positive for weed. He tried to get ahead of the situation by telling my parents what had happened. My parents freaked out, acted like John is a complete failure, and started to think of ways to punish him. My parents and my brother already didn't. (/# MC // section intro) #Introduction Welcome, dear people of the subreddit!

President Donald Trump directed his longtime attorney Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about negotiations to build a Trump Tower in Moscow, according to two federal law enforcement officials involved in an investigation of the matter. Trump also supported a plan, set up by Cohen, to visit Russia during the presidential campaign, in order to personally meet President Vladimir Putin and jump-start the tower negotiations. “Make it happen,” the sources said Trump told Cohen. --- ##Submissions.

New User. I don't understand how it works here but I need a neutral perspective on this. Also long post is going to be too long. Here goes. My mom has had the short end of the stick since birth. She was (by my perspective) accidentally conceived to parents who couldn't afford it. She suffered as a kid at home and she had a brother who was the golden child.
