                            <p> Ok, first of all not trying to diss one song to praise another one. But holy shitt, I haven't seen worlds song getting outdone so quickly. Rise was a pretty good song, worthy to be world's song and the animation was amazing too. But I feel like I already forgot about it, POPSTAR is lit af, both song and animation. I LOVE IT. P.S: I've never cared much for KPop actually. I don't think I've ever heard any KPop (Does Gagnam style count? I dont even know). But I just heard Made a gif loop from my favorite K/DA - POP/STARS music video moment: Direct link ( or IMGUR (preview butchers gif quality) (https://imgur.com/de8tiA2) Update: Iconic Dance move as Gif and smartphone Lockscreen (https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/9u5ohf/kda_popstars_dance_smartphone_lockscreen/) Now available for wallpaper engine: LINK (https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/9twr3v/kda_popstars_4k_wallpaper_engine_machine_learni. https://imgur.com/a/WIbmwnw#WtLLTJJ.

Noise was added to prevent horrible H264 color banding ( which looks aweful in motion, regardless of bit-rate # COMPLEX UNIVERSES # Albion The great elven empires were shattered into remnants long ago, yet the elves remain. Kayle is a Forest Elf who has discovered her fallen people's lost magic, granting her power over nature. Morgana is a Dark Forest Elf who has chained evil, forbidden magic within her body. Ezreal is an adventuring elf presenting himself as a "handsome rogue-paladin" named Jarro Lightfeather. Ashe is a champion against oppression despite having been condemne. 
https://imgur.com/a/AR5N3I9 I was a little disappointed by the new Evelynn skin, especially compared to how well I thought Kaisa and Akali's skins turned out. So, I decided to do a quick edit of my own version.

The War of the Spark (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5W9t62t10I) Trailer made me (and judging by the comments, a lot of others) really wish the Magic movie would climb out of development hell. Right now, thanks to the hype around War of the Spark, existing fans are getting more interested in the story, and Arena is bringing in way more players than Magic had when the movie was first announced. If the movie is anything other than completely dead, now would be the time to get people talking.

I finally watched this tonight. It was hilarious! My brother-in-law and I are huge Lonely Island fans but we both had little kids when this movie came out and we haven’t had a “guys night” together until tonight. I saved this movie since it came out even though I have wanted to watch it so badly since it came out. People do not realize how difficult it is to make a great comedy. This movie was so funny - we laughed the entire time. Most comedies these days elicit maybe a chuckle but mostly. 
Well this came into my mind when I see Lizzos recent rise to fame, well she had albums before but her hits came this year Other come to mind like Jennifer Lopez(25+), Katy Perry(24ish), Kacey Musgraves(late 27+28ish) How do their careers effect in comparison to someone who started out like a child/teen prodigy like Miley Cyrus(13), Lorde(16), Taylor(17ish), Britney and many others How does it affect their target audience and demographic. Popstar ahri has unique dance animation, so I'm wandering why the KD/A skins don't have their own new dance animations. </p>
